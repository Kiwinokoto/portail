# Portail LGC — backlog / handoff

## Product decision — 30 September 2026

The portal is a temporary, lightweight pedagogical workspace while Moodle, Course Factory and Roads mature.
Primary navigation: **Formation → Subject → Subject pathway**.

Do not add a visible CAP/Bac Pro family level for now.

## P0 — foundations

- [x] Define product boundary and hierarchy.
- [x] Define admin / teacher authentication model.
- [x] Define SQLite schema for users, browser sessions, catalogue and class sessions.
- [x] Build first teacher shell: login, formations, subjects, create/reopen sessions.
- [x] Build minimal admin user management: create, rotate token, deactivate/reactivate.
- [x] Add signed student join URLs and QR generation endpoint.
- [x] Add tests for auth, catalogue, user lifecycle, session ownership and join signatures.
- [x] Bootstrap the new GitHub repository after the owner explicitly confirmed no concurrent agent work.
- [x] Merge the tested foundation branch into `main` (PR #1, `9c9ab71`).
- [x] Merge ADA French positioning V1 into `main` (PR #2, `45951f9`).
- [ ] Register `Kiwinokoto/portail` in AgentCtl when the admin broker is available, before shared/automated mutation becomes possible.
- [ ] Configure deployment secrets and deploy `portail.lagrandeclasse.fr` through the LGC Traefik network.

## P1 — first real teaching vertical

- [x] ADA → French positioning V1: signed learner join, own-name recognition and first-letter recognition.
- [x] Audio-first instructions with browser speech synthesis and visible-text fallback.
- [x] Persist lightweight learner activity events and expose a teacher-owned session summary.
- [x] Teacher live view using 4 s polling.
- [x] Remove first-entry typing: teacher-preloaded roster + learner selection with spoken-name support.
- [x] Minimise public roster identity to first name + optional last-name initial.
- [ ] Add safe roster edit/remove for corrections; current UI only appends and ignores exact duplicates.
- [ ] Decide whether multi-device selection of the same prepared learner needs a claim/device safeguard after classroom testing.
- [x] Add first oral-comprehension probe without reading: spoken everyday nouns → pictorial choices.
- [ ] Extend positioning further: visual discrimination, sound/letter matching, useful-word reading and writing gestures.
- [ ] Separate letter-name recognition from true phoneme↔grapheme assessment; do not infer decoding ability from the current first-letter task.
- [ ] Teacher preview bypasses learner locks.
- [ ] Corrections remain locked by default per class session and need a usable teacher control.
- [ ] Add per-item progress detail only where it helps the teacher act; avoid turning the portal into a full LMS gradebook.

## P2 — maths convergence

- [ ] Keep `maths_lgc` production untouched during portal bootstrap.
- [ ] Model PSR Mathematics in the portal as a legacy/external subject initially.
- [ ] Extract/reuse generic session and teacher ideas without copying maths-specific hard-coded stages.
- [ ] Decide how/when existing maths content is imported or linked into the portal.
- [ ] Add ADA numeracy foundation separately from CAP-level maths diagnostics.

## Moodle migration principle

This project must stay easy to dismantle or adapt:
- teacher/student identity → Moodle;
- groups/enrolment → Moodle;
- programme-level progression → Roads;
- ordinary authored content → Moodle / Course Factory;
- high-value interactive exercises may remain as embedded/external activities.

## Current handoff — 30 September 2026

`main` is at `34b6539` after the tested oral-comprehension merge (PR #4).

Current development branch: `dev/ada-positioning-order-v1`, created directly from that `main`.

This corrective pass changes only the learner sequence: **identity selection → oral comprehension → own-name recognition → first-letter recognition → finish**. It restores the documented oral-before-written principle without changing the backend, event schema or SQLite data.

The oral pictograms remain temporary platform emoji and need validation on the actual classroom devices. The owner explicitly confirmed there is no local clone, no unpushed work and no remaining previous-agent activity. AgentCtl registration is still pending only because RDC/admin broker access is unavailable today.

No deployment has been attempted.
